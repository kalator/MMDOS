This python script was written as a semestral project for 155UZPD at CTU in Prague, Faculty of Civil Engineering, 
it can be used to find the shortest way from one Prague address to another.

Please note that the app finds the shortest path, not the fastest, doesn't take into account the timetables and that transfers usually slow you down.
